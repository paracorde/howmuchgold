# howmuchgold
How much gold will it take to hit your comp? Is it better to level or stay at the same level?

This tool simulates rolldowns at your current level and at a level above, including parameters like other units taken out of the pool and the amount of contested units to hopefully answer those questions. Note: gold averages includes buying the units themselves.
